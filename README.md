Urlenco.de
===========



### Introduction

[Urlenco.de](http://urlenco.de) is the code base behind a fun little URL shortener application
that I wrote "once upon a time". Originally Urlenco.de was built on top of ASP.NET running on top 
of [Mono](http://mono-project.com), [Lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/) (via FastCGI) and 
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/). This codebase however is a completely rewritten from
scratch using [Eventlet](http://eventlet.net), [Cheetah](http://cheetahtemplate.org), [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/) and my 
own tiny MVC framework "[MicroMVC](http://github.com/rtyler/MicroMVC)".
